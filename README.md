**Implemented a todo list application using React's Context API for state management, and TailwindCSS for design. Created a TodoContext to hold the list of items and methods for adding and deleting items. Used a custom hook, useTodoContext, to consume the context in components. The ListContainer component utilized the context to display the list of items and manage the state for adding new items. The ListItem component accessed the context to handle item deletion and cancellation. This approach improved code organization and allowed for more efficient state sharing between components. Deployed using AWS App Runner.**
